<!--
	Workstation dependent ANT setup include in "build-common.xml"
	
	1.Property "workdir" must be set to absolute path to one folder above the
	  location of this file so that /src and /out would be a subfolder of it, ie.:
	   
	  c:\w\uct\lib\java\src\build-common.xml
	  
	  requires:
	  
	  workdir = c:\w\uct\lib\java\

        1.1 What is workdir?

            A root of a source tree where You keep:

               workdir\src\sztejkat\abstractmf\... java files and sources go here
               workdir\out\sztejkat\abstractmt\...  class files and resources will be produced there.

           If this does not suite Your needs check build-common.xml
	  
	2.Property jdk is the optional location of API folder of JAVADOC from JDK to which
	JavaDoc should generate links when generating Your own JAVA-DOC.
-->			
	<!--
		URL to jdk docs
	-->
	<property name="jdk_doc" value="" />
	<!-- 
		A directory, where all sources and outputs will be held
	-->
	<property name="workdir" value="/home/sztejkat/uct/lib/java" />
	<!-- 
		JDK Java home, the location where JDK is installed.
		For best effects keep it without spaces.
	-->	
	<!-- <property name="javahome" value="c:\jdk1.7.0_02" />-->
	 <property name="javahome" value="/usr/lib/jvm/java-8-openjdk-amd64" />

		TLDR:
			If (JDK version >= 1.9) and (ANT version < 1.9.8) and (when you not provide a substitute tool) set this property to false.
		
		Details:
			native2ascii tool was removed with JDK version 9. All build tools should take into account that this tool isn't avaliable.
			https://bugs.java.com/bugdatabase/view_bug.do?bug_id=JDK-8074431
			
			ANT with version < 1.9.8 will output error when using native2ascii task and this tool isn't availiable in system.
			https://bz.apache.org/bugzilla/show_bug.cgi?id=59855
			
			Testing scrpitdef with option language="javascript" resulted with output: "Warning: Nashorn engine is planned to be removed from a future JDK release".
			The conclusion is using scripting is very risky.
			
			Checking for tool existence by file is not portable between systems because of different filename extensions.
			
			There is no way to compare versions in ANT without scripting or extensions.
			There is no legit way to check native2ascii for avaliability.
