      This package contains a binary, chunk based stream format.

      <h1>Introduction</h1>
      As mentioned elswere in a generic descirption of signal based
      format the basic requirement of any format is an ability to
      clearly identify where is next signal.
      <p>
      This can be, in generic, achived by following means:
      <ul>
          <li>by having a known reserved sequence of characters or bytes
          used to indicate the signal, conceptualy close to <code>&lt;</code> in XML;</li>
          <li>to have a syntax we need track precisely, as in JSON or XML formats;</li>
          <li>to know exactly how far from "here" the signal resides in stream.</li>
      </ul>
      This package uses the last method.

     <h2>What is chunk based format?</h2>
     The chunk format is "binary", that is it works on <code>bytes</code>
     as the <code>InputStream/OutputStream</code> and looks for signals by exactly
     knowing where they are next in stream.
     <p>
     This knowledge is achived by dividing stream into sequence of "chunks" of
     know size, where some chunks do indicate that there are signals and some are
     used just for stream management.

     <h2>How chunk is made?</h2>
     A chunk is basically made of a "header" and a "payload" which follows it.

     <h2>What is header for?</h2>
     Header do carry information about if or what signal is encoded by it and
     how large the payload is. Efficiently knowing a header we know a playload
     size and we can skip it, thous find a header of a next chunk.

     <h2>What is payload?</h2>
     Everything what is written by primitive writing API (user payload)
     or used to store signal  names is an direct, variable length form (system payload)
     <p>
     There is however no
     requirement that each written primitive must be fully contained in one chunk.
     They can cross chunk boundary, providing some conditions specified later are met.

     <h1>Binary chunk format</h1>
     In this chapter I will present how exactly this format is encoded.
     <p><i>
     Notice however, that the implementing code is somewhat more open and more layered
     and can be used to implement other encodings than this presented here. I do like it
     best and find it to be almost optimal so I will stick with it.</i>

     <h2>Header types</h2>
     The binary format always starts from a "header", because it is essential to know
     what we are having in stream next.
     <p>
     We have following types of headers:
     <table border="1">
     <tr>
     <td><b>type</b></td><td>meaning</td>
     </tr>
     <tr>
     <td><code>register</code></td><td>used to provide signal name registration information. This
     allows us to replace most frequently used names with numbers instead of long strings of characters.</td>
     </tr>
     <tr>
     <td><code>begin_direct</code></td><td>used to provide begin signal with signal name present directly in stream</td>
     </tr>
     <tr>
     <td><code>end_begin_direct</code></td><td>used to provide end signal, followed by begin signal with signal name present directly in stream</td>
     </tr>
     <tr>
     <td><code>begin_registered</code></td><td>used to provide begin signal with signal name registered previously under a specific number</td>
     </tr>
     <tr>
     <td><code>end_begin_registered</code></td><td>used to provide end signal, followed by begin signal with signal name registered previously under a specific number</td>
     </tr>
     <tr>
     <td><code>end/end_name</code></td><td>used to provide end signal or to terminate a directly encoded name</td>
     </tr>
     <tr>
     <td><code>continue</code></td><td>used to indicate, that next chunk is just a payload of known size without any signal.
     It is transparent to any payload write/read operation and is just adding a size to previous payload.</td>
     </tr>
     <tr>
     <td><code>extented_registered</code></td><td>used to encode <code>end_begin_registered/begin_registered</code>
     headers using longer, less efficient but more flexible form</td>
     </tr>
     </table>
     <i>Notice, we have exactly eight types of headers used to formulate 11 logic types. This complexity is intentional
     as it allows to pack most frequently used scenarios optimally into a smallest number of bytes.</i>

     <h2>Header encoding</h2>
     Each of above headers always starts from a byte which is interpreted like below:
     <pre>
        bit 7        0
             xxxx xHHH
     </pre>
     where <code>HHH</code> indicates type of header:
     <pre>
          HHH
           000 - register
           001 - begin_direct
           010 - end_begin_direct
           011 - begin_registered
           100 - end_begin_registered
           101 - end/end_name
           110 - continue
           111 - extented_registered
     </pre>
     The meaning of <code>xxx</code> depends on header type.

     <h3>register</h3>
     A header used to form "name registration". This header can have two forms:
     <p>
     It can either directly carry the index under which register a name:
     <pre>
          ???? 1000
          ?iii iiii
     </pre>
     or indirectly, by order of appearance:
     <pre>
          ???? 0000
     </pre>
     Both forms <u>cannot be mixed</u> in one stream.
     <p>
     The <code>?</code> are ignored and <code>iii iiii</code> is the index (0...127) under which
     a name following it should be put into a name registry.
     <p>
     The <code>register</code> header is always followed by either <code>begin_direct</code> or <code>end_begin_direct</code>
     header which is assumed to both carry a signal and a name which needs to be registered under and index/order specified
     by <code>register</code> header.
     <p>
     <i>Note: This is allowed to extend this pool, assuming <code>extented_registered</code> header is also modified.
     Personally I think that the number of 128 compact names is a good trade-off between size of an index and
     a need of optimization of most frequently used names.</i>

     <h3>begin_direct</h3>
     This header is indicating that a begin signal is present and do carry a signal name encoded directly using
     an encoding which is specified in <a href="#STRING_ENCODING">that chapter</a>.
     <p>
     This header looks like:
     <pre>
          ssss s001
     </pre>
     where <code>ssss_s</code> is system payload size, 0...31 bytes.
     <p>
     The system payload do carry the name encoded as specified above. The name is terminated by <code>end/end_name</code>
     header and may spread across many <code>continue</code> chunks.
     <p>
     If this header is preceeded by <code>register</code> it means "and once name is read, put it into a name registry".

     <h3>end_begin_direct</h3>
     This header is indicating that an end signal is present, followed right in place by a begin signal and
     carry a signal name encoded directly encoded exactly as in <code>begin_direct</code> signal.
     <p>
     This header looks like:
     <pre>
          ssss s010
     </pre>
     <p>
     If this header is preceeded by <code>register</code> it means "and once name is read, put it into a name registry".


     <h3>begin_registered</h3>
     This header is indicating that a begin signal is present and do carry a signal name encoded by a short-form
     index.
     <p>
     This header looks like:
     <pre>
          SSii i011
     </pre>
     where:
     <pre>
          iii - index of name in a registry, short 0...7 (as registered by <code>register</code>)
          SS - size of payload encodes as follows:
            00 - 1 byte  <i>(good for boolean and byte elementary primitive)</i>
            01 - 2 bytes <i>(good for char and short elementary primitive)</i>
            10 - 4 bytes <i>(good for int and float elementary primitive)</i>
            11 - 8 bytes <i>(good for long and double elementary primitive)</i>
     </pre>
     <i>Note: This form of header was chosen due to the fact, that the most needed cause of using names registry
     is to provide a type information during implementation of <code>ITypedStructWriteFormat</code>.
     Since we have eight (<code>boolean,byte,char,short,int,long,float,double</code>) elementary types which
     needs to be encoded in a shortest possible way this header allows to name them using only one byte.
     <br>
     Notice that a very compact type information in case of arrays or strings is not critical, as they will usually be
     long enough so that two bytes won't do many harm.</i>

     <h3>end_begin_registered</h3>
      This header is indicating that an end signal is present followed right in place by a begin signal and do carry a signal name encoded by a short-form
     index.
     <p>
     This header looks like:
     <pre>
          SSii i100
     </pre>
     All other properties are the same as in <code>begin_registered</code> header.

     <h3>end/end_name</h3>
     This is a dual purpose header:
     <ul>
         <li>first use after <code>begin_direct</code> or <code>end_begin_direct</code> indicates that name
         is finished and a user payload follows.
         <p>
         <i>Note: Even if there is no actual payload (ie. <code>begin_direct;end</code> sequence without
         any user data) both end headers must be present:
         <pre>
              begin_direct
              <i>name</i>
              <i>possibly some continue chunks</i>
              end with zero payload size
              end  &larr; <i>this can't be ommited.</i>
         </pre>
         </i>

         </li>
         <li>all other uses do indicate that an end signal is present;</li>
     </ul>
      This header looks like:
     <pre>
          ssss s101
     </pre>
      where <code>ssss s</code> is a size of payload, 0...31 bytes.


     <h3>continue</h3>
     This header does not carry any signal and is just used to add additional payload to a payload present
     in previous chunk.
     <p>
     This header has forms:
     <pre>
          form 1:
               ssss 0110
          form 2:
               ssss 1110
               SSSS SSSS
     </pre>
     where <code>ssss</code> are four less significant bits of size of payload (user or system, depending on context)
      and <code>SSSS SSSS</code> are eigth more significant.
     <p>
     Form 1 allows chunk size of 0...15 bytes, form 2 of 0...4095 bytes.
     <p>
     This chunk is <u>fully transparent</u> for names and primitive reading/writing API.
     <p>
     <i>Note: This is possible to variant this format to have longer chunks but it will require larger buffers
     on both sides. Notice this size of chunk produces about 0.05% of size cost what is fairly acceptable.</i>


     <h3>extented_registered</h3>
     This header is used used to implement longer, more flexible form of <code>begin_registered</code>
     or <code>end_begin_registered</code> and has following forms:
     <pre>
          extended_begin_registered:

             ssss s111
             0iii iiii

          extended_end_begin_registered:

             ssss s111
             1iii iiii
     </pre>
     where <code>ssss s</code> is a size of payload, 0...31 bytes and <code>iii</code> is an index
     of a name of a signal in a name registry, 0...127 (as registered by <code>register</code>).
     <p>
     <i>Note: This form allows use of the entire range of names and a complete set of sizes,
     including missing in short forms 0,3,5,6,7.</i>


     <h1>Primitive data encoding</h1>
     This chapter will explain how primitives are encoded.
     
     <h2>Elementatry primitives</h2>
     <h3>boolean</h3>
     A single, elementary boolean is encoded as a single byte, zero for false
     and 1 for true. Other values are the reason to throw <code>EBrokenFormat</code>
     
     <h3>byte</h3>
     As a byte.
     
     <h3>short &amp; char</h3>
     As two bytes, less significant byte first:
     <pre>
                       bits
     	   byte 0 : 7....0
     	   byte 1 : 15...8
     </pre>
     
     <h3>int</h3>
     As four bytes, less significant bytes first.
     <pre>
                       bits
     	   byte 0 : 7....0
     	   byte 1 : 15...8
     	   byte 2 : ......
     	   byte 3 : 31....
     </pre>
     
     <h3>long</h3>
     As eight bytes, less significant bytes first.
     <pre>
                       bits
     	   byte 0 : 7....0
     	   byte 1 : 15...8
     	   ....
     	   byte 7 : 63....
     </pre>
     
     <h3>float</h3>
     As an <code>int</code> after conversion with <code>Float.floatToRawIntBits</code>.
     
     <h3>double</h3>
     As an <code>long</code> after conversion with <code>Double.doubleToRawLongBits</code>.
     

     <h2>Block primitives</h2>
     <h3>byte[],char[],short[],int[],long[],float[],double[]</h3>
     Those blocks of primitives are encoded by directly writing their elements
     as if they were elementary primitives. No length information is stored
     and a block is terminated by any header except <code>continue</code>.
     
     <h3>String</h3>
     String is encoded in a form of bytes, character after character,
     where is character is stored using the encoding
     specified in <a href="#STRING_ENCODING">this chapter</a>.
     
     <h3>boolean[]</h3>
     Boolean arrays are encoded as a sequence of packed bit-streams:
     <pre>
     		bbbb  bbbb
     		7...  ...0
     		15... ...8
     		....
     		255....
     </pre>
     where:
     <ul>
     	<li><code>bbbb bbbb</code> number of bits in a bit-stream minus one.
     	There is no zero size bit-streams and the size of bit stream 
     	is 1...256 bits;</li>
     	<li>the number of bytes following the <code>bbbb bbbb</code> is
     	rounded up to the number of bytes necessary to hold specified number
     	of bits, 1...32 bytes;</li>
     	<li>up to 7 bits may be un-used in a last byte and those bits must be zero;</li>
     </ul>
     Packed bit-streams do appear one after another, until the terminating
     header (any other than <code>continue</code>) is written. There is neither a requirement
     that packed bit-streams do fit in chunk nor that there has to be any rule
     about their size. A sequence of 1 bit sized streams is a fully correct one
     and <u>may</u> actually appear in stream if stream is flushed frequently.
     
     
     
     <h3 id="STRING_ENCODING">String encoding</h3>
     Strings (both for names and primitive block API) are encoded in a packed, UTF-8 alike form using following rule:
     <pre>
               character code          byte sequence
          0000_0000--0AAA_AAAA &rarr;  0AAA_AAAA
          00BB_BBBB--BAAA_AAAA &rarr;  1AAA_AAAA 0BBB_BBBB
          CCBB_BBBB--BAAA_AAAA &rarr;  1AAA_AAAA 1BBB_BBBB 0000_00CC

          where 0 means: "this bit must be zero" and letters do describe any bits.
     </pre>
     thous allows packing all ASCII chars (most frequent in western languages) into 1 byte,
     and all others into up to 3 bytes. This is not an UTF-8 encoding, but is simpler and
     a tiny bit more dense.
     <p>
     This encoding takes no account for upper or lower surogates and encodes
     <code>char</code> comming from JAVA exactly as they are, without assuming that
     they do represent UTF-16 encoded 0...0x10FFFF bit code-points.
     <p>
     Thanks to that it can be used to encode absolutely any <code>char[]</code>
     which may appear in JAVA, even if it does not represent a valid <code>String</code>.


     <h1>Impact of <code>flush()</code> operation</h1>
     A <code>flush()</code> must ensure that all data passed through the API
     must actually get into an underlying low level stream. Since chunk and packed bit-stream 
     composition do require buffering (we need to know which size to write in 
     a header) this operation must empty those buffers.
     <p>
     Whenever format is flushed following actions do take place:
     <ul>
     	<li>if bit-packed <code>boolean []</code> stream is beeing collected due to
     	boolean block in progress this stream is terminated. If it is non-zero size
     	its header is updated and the stream is flushed to chunk buffer. If it is zero
     	size nothing is done.
     	<p>
     	The process of flushing it to chunk buffer may result in flushing the chunk,
     	starting the <code>continue</code> chunk, flushing it and so on until the entire
     	bit-packed stream is flushed.
     	</li>
     	<li>the chunk in progress is flushed to an underlying stream. 
     	This process involves selection of a proper header, writing it to a stream
     	and writing necessary user and system payloads;</li>
     </ul>
     The side effect of flush is such that both bit-packed <code>boolean []</code> streams and
     chunks are terminated pre-maturely and the additional fragmentation do appear in
     a low level binary stream.
     <p>
     Simply speaking, the format which wrote the same data and flushed
     frequently will produce a file which is <u>larger</u> than a file for
     the same data made with no additional flushing.
     <p>Except of that there should be no implact whatsoever on how reading 
     end is processing it.
     <p>
     Formats which are not intended to support any "end-of-file" modes different
     than "none" are recommended to silently ignore user flush requests and rely 
     on auto-flushing only.
