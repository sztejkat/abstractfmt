      This package contains a binary, escaped based stream format.

      <h1>Introduction</h1>
      As mentioned elswere in a generic descirption of signal based
      format the basic requirement of any format is an ability to
      clearly identify where is next signal.
      <p>
      This can be, in generic, achived by following means:
      <ul>
          <li>by having a known reserved sequence of characters or bytes
          used to indicate the signal, conceptualy close to <code>&lt;</code> in XML;</li>
          <li>to have a syntax we need track precisely, as in JSON or XML formats;</li>
          <li>to know exactly how far from "here" the signal resides in stream.</li>
      </ul>
      This package uses the first method.

      <h1 id="PROCESS">What is an "escaped format"?</h1>
      An escaped format is using certain, reserved sequence to indicate the presence
      of a signal.
      <p>
      Of course such a seqence has a certain chance to appear in regular data too.
      If it happens, it must be "escaped" to avoid missinterpretation.
      <p>
      For an example if byte 0x33 is an escape then we may assume, that
      if 0x33 appears in a regular data it must be replaced with 0x33 0x33.
      <p>
      A reader works opposite: it reads a byte, and if it is the escape byte then it reads next
      one byte too.
      <p>
      If both are 0x33 then it returns just one 0x33 as a data and
      skips the second. If second byte is not 0x33, it detects a signal
      and that second byte controls what kind of signal it is.

      <h1>Escape byte selection</h1>
      One may easily notice that if, by chance, we would have to write
      a data block: <code>0x33,0x33,0x33...</code> then all the bytes would have
      to be escaped and the size of block would double. This is not nice.
      <p>
      This means, that the efficiency of a format for certain data may be very, very poor
      and that this is very hard to predict what escape will be the best.

      <h2 id="ADAPTIVE">Adaptive escape</h2>
      To overcome above limitiations one may think about using "adaptive escape"
      algorithm which is presented below.
      <p>
      Let us assume, that we have a data struct:
      <pre>
           byte escapes_count [256]; //bytes used as unsigned numbers
           byte escape;  //initially at known number.
      </pre>
      where <code>escape</code> is a current escape byte.
      <p>
      Each time we either needed (past intentional) to escape written data or we detected escaped data
      we do:
      <pre>
           int i = 0xff & escape;
           //increment escape, detect binary roll-over
           //or use other known way of detecting it
           int c = (++escapes_count[ i ]);
           if ( c == 0xFF) //a top limit
           {

                      //find which of escapes had to be escaped smaller number of times
                      //Do it in predictable way even if many do have same count.
                      int min = Byte.MAX_VALUE+1;
                       int j = -1;
                       for(int i=255; --i>=0; )
                       {
                        int v = escapes_count[i] & 0xff;
                        if (v &lt min)
                        {
                         min = v; j = i;
                         }
                       }
                       //use found less times escaped escape and use as next escape.
                       escape = (byte)j;

                      //scale the balance down to make some room till next computatin
                      //needs to take place
                      for( i=255; --i>=0; )
                      {
                              escapes_count[i] >>> 1; //unsigned shift
                      }
            }
      </pre>
      Since the algorithm is triggered by the same action and data
      on both ends of a stream both ends will be deducing same escape byte
      to be used next.
      <p>
      This method should select best, less expensive escape regardless of
      what data are written to a stream.
      <p>
      This method changes the scape character one it was detected 255 times in
      a data for the first time, and 127 times for subsequent uses.
      This dynamics may be adjusted by modifying top limit, but care must be
      taken that both ends do use the same top limit or otherwise reader
      will get totally lost.
      <p>
      Notice however, that this kind of adaptive escape has one huge disadvantage:
      the signal is recognized by a sequence:
      <pre>
           escape
           signal_code
      </pre>
      and escaping payload is using:
      <pre>
           escape
           escape
      </pre>
      This means, that to be able to correctly detect signal the
      <code>escape</code> must be always different from all possible <code>signal_code</code>.
      <p>
      In practice it would either strongly harm the adaptivity or we would have to use:
      <pre>
           escape
           ~escape    <i>; or otherwise altered escape</i>
           signal_code
      </pre>
      what would harm the efficiency of a stream.

      <h2>Efficiency</h2>
      Now we should consider an efficincy of such an encoding.
      What is visible at first glance it is the fact, that escape
      encoding requires <u>more</u> bytes to encode a small registered
      sub-set of signals than chunk based encoding.
      <p>
      Let us compute it.
      <p>
      Considering example stream of infinite number of random ints (4 bytes)
      enclosed in <code>end-begin("int")</code> signals using short, directly encoded
      name registry the chunk format will use 5 bytes for each int resulting in
      a constant 80% efficiency.
       <p>
      The efficiency of escape stream will depend on a data.
      <p>
      For single escape character the chance of hitting it in random byte is 1:256,
      and if we hit it, we need to pay a price of one additional byte with that
      probability.
      This means that we can add an average 1:256 of byte cost per each byte in
      N-byte long sequence.
      <p>
      Considering the fact, that we need one escape byte, one signal byte and four
      data bytes we have a total load per end-begin wrapped integer:
      <pre>
           2+ 4 * (1+1:256) = 6.015
      </pre>
      what gives us 66% efficiency.
      <p>
      For alike stream carying random bytes the efficiency of chunk stream is 50%
      and the efficiency of single escape stream is about:
      <pre>
           2+1*(1+1:256) = 3.004 = 33% efficiency
      </pre>
       <p>
      If however we consider longer sequences, knowing that "continue" chunk can
      carry 4095 bytes at additional cost of 2 bytes we have chunk stream efficiency
      of 99.95% while the escape stream of that size would have:
      <pre>
      4095*(1+1:256) = 4111 = 99.6%
      </pre>
      Once can see that at no condition the escape stream will be more efficient
      than chunk based stream.

      <h2>Set-adaptive escapes</h2>
      Having just one escape byte is both good and bad.
      <p>
      It is good, because it affects data in a less possible way and it is bad
      because shorest signal will need two bytes at least. This is two times
      more than in a chunk format.
      <p>
      If we would however reserve 17 bytes for escapes, of which 8 would describe
      "begin-registered-x" and 8 "end-begin-registered-x" and last will open
      "long signal" the situation would change.
      <p>
      The overhead for a small subset of registered signals is now just one byte,
      exactly as in chunk format.
      <p>
      Considering again the 4-byte integer we can compute:
      <pre>
           1+4*(1+17/256) = 5.26
      </pre>
      what gives 76% efficiency which is very much worse than in chunk system.
      <p>
      The efficiency of 17 escapes stream for signle bytes wrapped alike manner will be:
      <pre>
           1 + 1*(1+17/256) = 2.066  = 48%
      </pre>
      which is again a fair result compared with 50% of chunk stream.
      <p>
      The 4095 long sequence efficiency will be:
      <pre>
      4095*(1+17:256) = 4367 = 94%
      </pre>
      which is significantly worse. Chunk stream would have alike efficiency if
      the longest chunk would be 31 bytes.
      <p>
      As one can see this again <u>cannot compete</u> with chunk based stream.



      <h2>Advantages? Any?</h2>
      Basically two:
      <ol>
          <li>No need of 4k buffer on writing side, just 32 bytes for boolean packed sequence is enough
          and even that can be reduced if we will skip <coce>boolean []</code> packing;</li>
          <li>An ability to restore synchronisation after some data loss. I will discuss it below.</li>
      </ol>
      <h3>Restoring synchronisation</h3>
      If You will loose any byte in chunk format You are doomed. There is absolutely no way to guess were
      next signal will be in stream.
      <p>
      In escape based stream it is enough to await for either of two:
      <ul>
          <li>EOF followed by escape followed by non-escape or;</li>
          <li>non escape followed by escape followed by non-escape;</li>
      </ul>
      Fist condition will matter only in systems which do use EOF to insert a time-space between zero level
      structures, second can catch up to signal at any level. Having signal found and having known set of
      zero-level signals one can re-synchronize with data stream again.


      <h2>Recomendations</h2>
      Use escape stream only when either of two happens:
      <ul>
          <li>Your system is very constrained in terms of memory or;</li>
          <li>You don't have any robust low level transport layer and predict some data loss;</li>
      </ul>
      Notice, in second case You will still need some transport layer to provide check-sums and etc,
      so Your profits are still almost none.



      <h1>Format definition</h1>
      This format is using single escape byte.
      <h2>Initial escape byte</h2>
       Initial escape byte is 0x80 (1000_0000) and cannot be parameterized.
       <p>
       This was chosen such, since it has
       a good chance to be a best guess if plenty of data are <code>String</code>
       encoded as specified <a href="#STRING_ENCODING">there</a>. And this chance
       is not small since <code>String</code> will be used for encoding signal
       names.
      <h2>Adaptivity</h2>
      This format is <u>not adaptive</u>.

      <h2>Signal types and encoding</h2>
      We should take care to encode registered signals in a very compact form
      we do encode following set of signals:
      <table border="1">
      <tr>
          <td>begin-direct</td><td>used to provide begin signal followed by directly encoded signal name;</td>
      </tr>
      <tr>
          <td>end-begin-direct</td><td>used to provide end signal followed by begin signal followed by directly encoded signal name;</td>
      </tr>
      <tr>
          <td>begin-register</td><td>used to provide begin signal followed by optional index and directly encoded signal name;</td>
            </tr>
      <tr>
          <td>end-begin-register</td><td>used to provide end signal followed begin signal followed by optional index and directly encoded signal name;</td>
            </tr>
      <tr>
          <td>begin-registered</td><td>used to provide begin signal followed by signal index;</td>
            </tr>
      <tr>
          <td>end-begin-register</td><td>used to provide end signal followed begin signal followed by signal index;</td>
            </tr>
      <tr>
          <td>end/end-name</td><td>used to provide end signal or end of directly encoded name;</li>
      </tr>
      </table>

      <h2>Signals</h2>
        Each signal is formed by a <code>header</code> followed by a <code>payload</code>.
        <p>
        Payload is passed through the escaping process described <a href="#PROCESS">there</a>
        so that no <code>escape</code> followed by <code>non-escape</code> is present inside a
        payload.
        <p>
        A header is always formed by:
        <pre>
          1000 0000  <i>; escape</i>
          0sss_ssss
        </pre>
        where no <code>sss_ssss</code> is <code>signal code</code>.

      <h3>begin-direct</h3>
        This signal is encoded as:
        <pre>
             1000 0000 <i>; escape</i>
             0000 0000
        </pre>
        After this signal we have a name first encoded as <a href="#STRING_ENCODING">specified there</a>
        then passes through payload escape process and terminated with <code>end/end-name</code> signal.

      <h3>end-begin-direct</h3>
       This signal is encoded as:
        <pre>
             1000 0000 <i>; escape</i>
             0000 0001
        </pre>
        and followed by the same data as in <code>begin-direct</code>.

      <h3>begin-register</h3>
       This signal is encoded in two forms:
        <pre>
             1000 0000 <i>; escape</i>
             0000 0010
             iiii iiii
        </pre>
        where <code>i</code> is a directly encoded index of a signal or:
        <pre>
             1000 0000 <i>; escape</i>
             0000 0011
        </pre>
        where index is deduced from an order of appearance.
        <p>
        In both cases this sequence is followed by an escaped encoded signal name terminated by <code>end/end-signal</code>
        exactly as in <code>begin-direct</code>
        <p>
        The name is to be registered under a specified or deduced index.
        <p>
        Both forms cannot be mixed in one stream.

      <h3>end-begin-register</h3>
       This signal is encoded in two forms:
        <pre>
             1000 0000 <i>; escape</i>
             0000 0100
             iiii iiii
        </pre>
        where <code>i</code> is a directly encoded index of a signal or:
        <pre>
             1000 0000 <i>; escape</i>
             0000 0101
        </pre>
         where index is deduced from an order of appearance.
         <p>
         It is used in a way and followed by the same data as <code>begin-register</code>

       <h3>begin-registered</h3>
       This signal is encoded in two forms:
       <pre>
            1000 0000 <i>; escape</i>
            0iii 0110 <i> idx= 0000 0iii</i>
       </pre>
       or
       <pre>
            1000 0000 <i>; escape</i>
            0000 0111
            iiii iiii <i> idx=iiii iiii</i>
       </pre>
       where in both cases <code>idx</code> is the index of signal name in signal name registry.
       <p>
       <i>Note: The eight quickly encoded names can be used to efficiently implement the
       type-stream and can be used to denote eight elementary Java types. This is the same
       trick as in chunk-stream.</i>

       <h3>end-begin-registered</h3>
       This signal is encoded in two forms:
       <pre>
            1000 0000 <i>; escape</i>
            0iii 1000 <i> idx= 0000 0iii</i>
       </pre>
       or
       <pre>
            1000 0000 <i>; escape</i>
            0000 1001
            iiii iiii <i> idx=iiii iiii</i>
       </pre>
       where in both cases <code>idx</code> is the index of signal name in signal name registry.

       <h3>end/end-name</h3>
       This signal is encoded as:
       <pre>
            1000 0000 <i>; escape</i>
            0000 1010
       </pre>
       and either indicates the stand-alone <code>end</code> signal or the end of directly encoded name.

       <h3>Prohibitted headers</h3>
       Any other header indicates an error and should result in <code>EBrokenFormat</code>.

      <h3 id="STRING_ENCODING">String encoding</h3>
     Strings (both for names and primitive block API) are encoded in a packed, UTF-8 alike form using following rule:
     <pre>
               character code          byte sequence
          0000_0000--0AAA_AAAA &rarr;  0AAA_AAAA
          00BB_BBBB--BAAA_AAAA &rarr;  1AAA_AAAA 0BBB_BBBB
          CCBB_BBBB--BAAA_AAAA &rarr;  1AAA_AAAA 1BBB_BBBB 0000_00CC

          where 0 means: "this bit must be zero" and letters do describe any bits.
     </pre>
     thous allows packing all ASCII chars (most frequent in western languages) into 1 byte,
     and all others into up to 3 bytes. This is not an UTF-8 encoding, but is simpler and
     a tiny bit more dense.
     <p>
     <i>
     Note: This is the same encoding as in a chunk format.</i>
