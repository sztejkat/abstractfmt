# Contributing guide

1. Read documentation.
2. Follow the testing, debuging and quality policies
  expressed in "package.html" file. This is essential.
3. Always document Your code telling:

  - what it **should** do;
  - what are boundary conditions in which it is to be used.

  There is no such a thing as "self commenting code", because
  so called "self commenting code" tells only what is **is doing**
  and always forgets to tell what it was expected to do.

4. I am not a GIT/GITHUB master and this project is experimental.
If You can help in managing it better You are welcomed.

Currently You need to "fork" the repository and use "issue" system
to create "pull request". Some of maintainers will pick it up,
but do not expect it to happen immediately unless the project will
reach thousand downloads.
