      This package defines how signal format is projected on XML file.

      <h1>Use of XML standard</h1>
      This format do produce "well formed XML", but cannot parse all
      "well formed" XMLs.

      <h2>XML schema</h2>
      The format is schema-less since there is no way to define schema
      for unknown data structures.

      <h2>XML body</h2>
      Opening stream opens XML body, closing stream closes it.

      <h2>Invalid characters</h2>
      XML defines following classes off "cannot encode" characters:
      <ul>
          <li>characters which are proper XML characters, but cannot be
          encoded using current low level character encoding;</li>
          <li>characters which cannot be used in XML regardless of how they are
          presented;</li>
          <li>characters which are valid but cannot be used for tag names, attribute names and etc;</li>
      </ul>
      First type of characters can be encoded using known set of entities in style
      <pre>
            &amp;<i>entity mnemonic</i>;
            &amp;#<i>unicode</i>;
      </pre>
      The set of supported mnemonics will be defined in implementing class.
      <p>
      Second type of characters cannot be present in XML file. Our abstract
      format do require however, that the entire 0...0xFFFF space of unicode
      characters can be used for names, elementary characters
      and strings.
      <p>
      The un-allowed XML characters cannot be encoded using <code>&amp;</code>
      convention because regular XML parsers will refuse to process them.
      <p>
      Unfortunately the set of characters which can begin a tag name is even
      more restrictive and we have to be able to use the whole set of characters
      in tag names. Thanks to some idiot who designed XML the first character of tag
      must be the "base char" what excludes any reasonable selection past true
      letters usable or _ or :. Where in fact : is also excluded due to later use
      for "namespace" handling. This means, that _ (U+005F, 95 decimal)
      is the only reasonable escape character we can actually use.
      <p>
      So this format is using:
      <pre>
           _                             &rarr; __
           <i>not allowed character U+xxxx</i>  &rarr; _xxxx
      </pre>
      that is the '_' is encoded as either <code>_005F</code>
      or <code>__</code> (double _). Any not allowed character is encoded
      using <code>_xxxx</code> syntax, where x are always four upper case hexadecimal
      digits.
      <p>
      The exact set of characters which are escaped vary depending on where they
      are used in XML. The smallest allowed set is used to start tag name, slightly
      larger in the remaning part of the name and largerst inside XML element body.

      <h2>Included XML, xlink and other extensions</h2>
      Not supported. A plain, single continous data character stream is to be used.

      <h2>XML comments</h2>
      Supported. May appear anywhere inside a tag body, including inside
      a primitive element, and may not appear inside a tag name itself.

      <h1>Adaptation of XML to signal format</h1>
      <h2>Begin signal</h2>
      Begin signal is always encoded directly, without any names registry
      and is represented as an opening XML tag:
      <pre>
            &lt;<i>nnnn</i>&gt;
      </pre>
      where <code>nnnn</code> is a signal name, with not allowed characters correctly escaped.

      <h2>End signal</h2>
      End signal in XML cannot be anonymous and must be encoded alike <code>begin</code> signal:
      <pre>
            &lt;/<i>nnnn</i>&gt;
      </pre>
      <p>
      <i>Note: The inablity to use "anonymous closing tag" <code> &lt;/&gt;</code>
      enforces stream writer to keep track of opened signals on a stack what may
      cause excesive memory consumption. Thous XML format do have some natural limit
      of recursion depth.</i>

      <h2>Tag body</h2>
      Inside a tag body elementary primitives are stored one by one, separated by <code>,</code> and optional
      ignorable white spaces.

      <h2>Elementary primitives</h2>
      Following encoding is used for elementary primitives:
      <table border="1">
      <tr>
          <th>Java type</th><th>encoded in tag body</th>
      </tr>
      <tr>
         <td>boolean</td><td>0,1</td>
      </tr>
      <tr>
          <td>byte,short,int,long</td><td>in one of two forms:
          <ul>
              <li>hexadecimal number, starting with "x" with leading zeroes skipped,  using always upper case characters to represent hex digits;</li>
              <li>decimal digit with optional leading + or - sign;</li>
          </ul>
          </td>
      </tr>
      <tr>
          <td>float,double</td>
          <td>
              in one of two forms:
              <ul>
                  <li>a hexadecimal int or long, after conversion from float to bits or;</li>
                  <li>as a floating point decimal number, with optional leading + or -, "." as decimal separator and E as exponent separator
                  with optional + or - exponent sign;</li>
              </ul>
          </td>
      </tr>
      <tr>
          <td>char</td><td>as " enclosed string, made of one or more characters, where not allowed characters and " are escaped.
                              Multiple chars can be stuck together in one string or written separately.
                              End of lines and whitespaces are encoded directly without any escaping</td>
      </tr>
      </table>

      <h2>Elementary sequences</h2>
      No special syntax. Just a plain sequence of elementary primitives without any indicator telling if to interprete them
      as a squence or single elements. The <code>String</code> and <code>char[]</code> are encoded excatly the same way
      and there are no means to tell them apart.


      <h2>Parsing</h2>
      The parser do make an attempt to parse next elementary element as it finds it and interprete it as requested.
      Following generic rules do apply:
      <ul>
          <li>for hexa-decimal number any of <code>boolean, byte,short,int,long, float, double</code> read can be used;</li>
          <li>for decimal integers any of <code>boolean, byte,short,int,long, float, double</code> read can be used;</li>
          <li>this is an error to read decimal floating point by <code>boolean, byte,short,int,long</code>;</li>
          <li>inside a " enclosed string only <code>char</code> or <code>String</code> can be read;</li>
      </ul>
      After sequence read is initialized the type of initialized sequence dictates what can be read and what can be not.
      <p>
      The <code>char[]</code> or <code>String</code> write can be split across multiple " enclosed strings, that  is:
      <pre>
           &lt;struct&gt;
                         "super",
                         "mario"
           &lt;/struct&gt;
      </pre>
      can be processes with a single <code>readString</code> returning <code>"supermario"</code> as read data.



     <h1>Additional information</h1>
     XML stream is by definition not typed and process of reading it may differ from
     the process of writing it. For an example a sequence of numbers may be read
     both with elementary primitives and with elementary sequence operation.
     <p>
     This is intentional since it simplifies the processing a lot.
     <p>
     This format is <u>not compact</u> and puts readability in front of compactness.
     This is also intentional since for a really compact storage we do have binary formats.
