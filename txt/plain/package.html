<body>
      An oversimplified text format laid directly on
      <code>sztejkat.abstractfmt.txt</code> engines.
      
      <h1>Format description</h1>
      This format does not implement neither "end-begin" optimization nor name
      registry.
      
      <h2>Encoding</h2>
      Unspecified, however thre is required that the entire <u>allowed</u>
      set of Unicode which may be carried by UTF-16 can be encoded in 
      a text file. Not allowed, bad UTF-16 sequences are escaped by this format.
      <p>
      Usually UFT-8 will be fine.
      <p>
      The writer writes \n as EOL, but reader is EOL agnostic and recognizes
      all \n,\r,\n\r,\r\n as valid single EOL sequence.

      
      
      <h1>Syntax description</h1>
      The syntax definiion is using a simplfied BNF notation
      <pre>
           a:= expression &larr; <i>syntax element defined by an "expression"</i>
      </pre>
      where expression is a either
      <pre>
      		sytax_element <i>operator</i>
      </pre>
      or
      <pre>
      		character <i>operator</i>
      </pre>
      where operator is optional and can be:
      <pre>
      	* - zero or more times
      	| - or
      	() - grouped expression
      	+ - one or more time
      	? - zero or one time.
      	?n - up to n times
      </pre>
      and characters are:
      <pre>
      	class:<i>description of character class</i> - specific unicode class
      	. - any character
      	[a-z,0-9] - any character from within range
      	^[a-z,0-9] - any character except those from within range
      </pre>
      
      
      <h1>Syntax definition</h1>
      The whole stream is defined as:
      <pre>
      	stream:= stream_element *
      </pre>
      where
      <pre>
      	stream_element:=
      					comment |
      					empty_character |
      					struct |
      					content ( empty_character* , empty_character* content)*
      	content:=
      				plain_token  |
      				quoted_token 
      	
      	comment:= # (^[newline_character])*
      	empty_character:= class:unicode whitespace, including new-lines
      	plain_token:= (^[empty_character , ; * # " , 0xD800-0xDFFF])*
      	quoted_token:= " (^[" | 0xD800-0xDFFF ] | escape )* "
      	escape:= (\\ | \[0-9,a-f,A-F]?4; | \" )
      	struct:= begin stream_element* end 
      	begin:= [*]plain_token |
      			[*]quoted_token
      	end:= ;
      </pre>
      what would be in a less formal terms:
      <ul>
      	<li>comment starts with # and lasts till end of line. Comments can happen anywhere, including
      	inside plain tokens but exluding quoted tokens and do not affect syntax;</li>
      	<li>plain tokens is made of non-white-spaces and excludes ,;*"# and <u>surogates</u>, even correct;</li>
      	<li>quoted token is made of any characters enclosed in "" where \ is used as an escape character
      	allowing directly escape any <code>0...0xFFFF</code> Java char value (not unicode code-point!) \" to escape double-quote
      	and \\ to escape \. We do allow unescaped correct surogates inside quouted tokens, but not inside un-quoted.
      	<p>
      	The escaping allows <u>up to</u> four hex digits and requires terminating semicolon.
      	<p>
      	Good escapes are:
      	<pre>
      	\3Af7;
      	\0000;
      	\; &rarr; \0000; 
      	\fe; \00FE;
      	</pre>
      	</li>
      	<li>tokens are separated by any white-spaces and comma;</li>
      	<li>struct starts with * followed by name of begin signal, either quoted or plain, and is terminated with semicolon;</li>
      	<li>You don't need comma between structs;</li>
      	<li>two consequenct , , with any spaces do indicate an empty token which is implemented as numeric zero
      	or character <code>(char)0</code>;</li>
      </ul>
      <h2>Examples</h2>
      <pre>
      # This is a file
      *start; # this is an empty structure
      123,
      33,44,"55" #those are numbers
      *"#complex name"33,"string of martini"; #and a structure with a content.
      </pre>
      
      <h1>Parsing tokens</h1>
      This format do write tokens using <code>sztejkat.abstractfmt.txt.ATxtReadFormat1</code> formating style
      and parses using <code>sztejkat.abstractfmt.txt.ATxtReadFormat0</code> rules.
      <p>
      From less formal point of view it means that:
      <ul>
      	<li>for formating:
      		<ul>
      			<li>all numeric values are encoded as decimals;</li>
      			<li>booleans are encoded as "t" or "f";</li>
      			<li>characters or string writes are always written as quoted tokens and are stitched together
      			into one long token;</li>
      			<li>comments are never written automatically, but API allows for that;</li>
      		</ul>
      	</li>
      	<li>for parsing:
		  <ul>
			<li>it doesn't matter if token is quoted or plain, the inside of it is processed regardless of a form;</li>
			<li>numeric <code>readXXX</code> always do load the whole token and are trying to parse it into a number
			of any float or integer form and interprete it, using everything Java can do. 
			The size of token is limited to a sane value and stream
			complains if it is too long;</li>
			<li>boolean reading additionally understands "true","t","false","f" case insensitive tokens;</li>
			<li>character or string methods always do process tokens character by character and transparently cross
			the token boundaries;</li>
		  </ul>
		 </li>
	</ul>
