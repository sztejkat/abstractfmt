      This package defines how signal format is projected on JSON file.

      <h1>Introduction to JSON</h1>
      JSON specs are included in <a href="doc-files/JSON_ECMA-404_2nd_edition.pdf">there</a>.
      <p>
      In short words JSON file is <u>one</u> JSON value which may be 
      a JSON object.
      
      
      <h2>JSON and struct format</h2>
      A JSON file may look like:
      <pre>
      {
      	"field":value,
      	"field":"value",
      	"substructure":{
      					"field":value
      					},
      	"field":[ value, value, { "name":value } ]
      }
      </pre>
      As You can see this format is basically a sequence of grouped
      <i>name/value</i> pairs or a list of <u>un-named</u> values.
      <p>
      At first glance it looks good but the primary problem for us
      is the the {} are not having own name. The name may come only
      from the <i>field</i> to which JSON object is assigned.
      And elements in list are not named.
      <p>
      In our struct format we do have <u>named</u> object containing
      a list of <u>unnamed</u> values or <u>named</u> objects.
      This might look like:
      <pre>
      	"name"{
      			value,
      			value,
      			value,
      			"name"{ .... }
      	}
      </pre>
      We can't transform it directly to JSON and some tricks will be 
      necessary.
      
      
      <h1>Characters encoding</h1>
      This package assumes UTF-8 encoding. However since we are using
      standard JAVA text I/O we do only require that encoding must
      support full set of unicode code points excluding bad surogates.
      
      
      
      <h1>Structure and stream</h1>
      We assume that the "structure" between <i>begin</i> and <i>end</i> signal
      is always represented in JSON as like:
      <pre>
      {
         "<i>signal_name</i>": [ <i>structure content</i> ]
      }
      </pre>
      More formally speaking we do represent:
      <ul>
      <li>structure with more than one element:
      <pre>
      {
         "<i>signal_name</i>": [ <i>element</i>, <i>element</i>,.... ]
      }
      </pre>
      </li>      
      <li>structure with one <u>primitive element</u>:
      <pre>
      {
         "<i>signal_name</i>": <i>primitive element</i>
      }
      </pre>
      The primitive element is numeric or logic or single character.
      </li>
      <li>structure with no elements:
      <pre>
      {
         "<i>signal_name</i>": []
      }
      </pre>
      </li>
      </ul>
      Notice we can detect "single element structure" only for elementary primitives
      because to do it we have to await for next operation and buffer every written
      character. Buffering strings or sub-structures would require unpredictable
      amount of memory.
      
      
      <h2>Primitive values</h2>
      Java primitives are converted to matching JSON numbers or logic types.
      <p>
      Characters are converted to JSON string. 
      Each elementary primitive character is stored as a separate JSON string
      of one character length, but characters blocks and strings
      are stitched into one JSON string. Except those there are no differences between
      strings, char sequences and elementary primitive char writes.
      <p>
      JSON <code>null</code> is not used.
      
      <h3>Escaping characters</h3>
      Since JSON works in a full UTF-16 realm we don't have to be picky and allow everything
      except the bad surogates. Bad surogates needs to be escaped directly using JSON syntax or low level
      UTF-8/UTF-16 streams will barf. Sadly Java does not support WTF-8.
      <p>
      JSON requires that only " and \ are escaped, we do however escape some characters
      from control ASCII zone (below 32) except new line characters. Those characters
      (del, backspace, page feed, bell and alike) usually do badly confuse text editiors.
     
      <h3>Parsing values</h3>
      Generic rules specified in <code>sztejkat.abstractfmt.txt.ATxtReadFormat0</code>
      do apply, so exact type matching between JSON and JAVA is not a special concern.
      
      
      <h2>Stream</h2>
      Since the struct format stream is not a part of a named struct the JSON
      representation of it looks like:
      <pre>
      [
      	<i>structs or elementary primitives</i>,....
      ]
      </pre>
      When parsing this class do allow for UTF-8 ByteOrderMark 0xFEFF to be present
      as a first character in a stream.
     
      
      <h2>Conformance with JSON standard</h2>
      <h3>When writing</h3>
      This format will produce valid JSON stream, but not necessairly a valid AJAX stream.
      
      <h3>When parsing</h3>
      This format will be able to process only such JSON stream which matches the 
      use of JSON described above.
      <p>
      This format will parse some invalid JSON files, especially it will parse 
      JSON logic or numbers or any non json string  tokens as "plain tokens" and will attempt to parse them 
      according to <code>sztejkat.abstractfmt.txt.ATxtReadFormat0</code> rules.
      <p>
      This means that below examples will be processes without an error:
      <pre>
      {
       	"sorki":0x33
       	}
      </pre>
      even tough it is not a valid JSON and that 0x33 can be read both as a number
      or as four primitive char elements or four characters long string.
      <p>
      This format will also understand single element structures with JSON string value
      with zero characters or more than one character:
      <pre>
      {
       	"sorki":"123"
       	}
      </pre>
      which will be processed, depending on a querry method used, as a number or as
      three characters or as three characters long string. 
      
      <h2>Impact of flush()</h2>
      If <code>flush()</code> is called after first element
      was written after begin signal the stream doesn't know yet
      if there is just a single element in structure or there will
      be more. It assumes then that there will be more elements
      and will write it using array form.
      <table border="2">
      <caption>Flush effects</caption>
      <tr style="color:#000000;background-color:#FFF0F0">
      <td>JAVA</td><td>JSON</td></tr>
      
      <tr> <td>
      <pre>
      	begin("ally");
      	writeInt(3);
      	end();
      </pre></td>
      <td>
      <pre>
      {"ally":3}
      </pre>
      </td>
      </tr>
      
      <tr> <td>
      <pre>
      	begin("ally");
      	writeInt(3);
      	flush();
      	end();
      </pre></td>
      <td>
      <pre>
      {"ally":[3]}
      </pre>
      </td>
      </tr>
      
      </table>
      <p>
      If <code>flush()</code> is called between string operations
      or char block operations the current JSON string is terminated
      and subsequent allowed  block operations will start new JSON
      string. This allows a complete token to be delivered to remote
      site.
     <table border="2">
      <caption>Flush effects</caption>
      <tr style="color:#000000;background-color:#FFF0F0">
      <td>JAVA</td><td>JSON</td></tr>
      
      <tr> <td>
      <pre>
      	begin("ally");
      	writeString("Mother of");
      	writeString("satan");
      	end();
      </pre></td>
      <td>
      <pre>
      {"ally":["Mother of satan"]}
      </pre>
      </td>
      </tr>
      
      <tr> <td>
      <pre>
      	begin("ally");
      	writeString("Mother of");
      	flush();
      	writeString("satan");
      	end();
      </pre></td>
      <td>
      <pre>
      {"ally":["Mother of","satan"]}
      </pre>
      </td>
      </tr>      
      </table>
