      This package defines how signal format is projected on JSON file.

      <h1>Introduction to JSON</h1>
      JSON specs are included in <a href="doc-files/JSON_ECMA-404_2nd_edition.pdf">there</a>.
      <p>
      In short words JSON file is <u>one</u> JSON value.
      <p>

      <h1>Stream</h1>
      We the assume, that our file is always a JSON array:
      <pre>
       [
        ....
       ]
      </pre>
      Opening stream writes "[", closing writes "]".

      <h1>Adaptation of JSON format</h1>
      <h2>Elementary primitives</h2>
      Following mapping is used:
      <table border="1">
      <tr>
          <th>Java type</th><th>JSON element</th>
      </tr>
      <tr>
         <td>boolean</td><td>JSON true or false</td>
      </tr>
      <tr>
          <td>byte,short,int,long,float,double</td><td>JSON number, except if float or double
          is infinity or NaN when "+Infinity" "-Infinity" or "NaN" JSON strings are used</td>
      </tr>
      <tr>
          <td>char</td><td>a JSON string. This is allowed to stitch together char operations into one String
             or split across many strings in any manner</td>
      </tr>
      </table>
      Note: Presented syntax do assume that comma is transparently
      placed where it should be and do ignore it.

      <h2>Elementary sequences</h2>
      Following mapping is used:
      <table border="1">
      <tr>
          <th>Java type</th><th>JSON element</th>
      </tr>
      <tr>
         <td>boolean [] </td><td>sequence (not JSON array) of JSON true or false</td>
      </tr>
      <tr>
          <td>byte[],short[],int[],long[],float[],double[]</td><td>sequence (not array) of JSON numbers,
          with exception as in elementary primitives</td>
      </tr>
      <tr>
          <td>char [], String</td><td>JSON String or sequence of strings</td>
      </tr>
      </table>

      <h2>Rules for parsing JSON elementary reads</h2>
      Following rules do apply:
      <table border="1">
      <tr>
          <th>JSON element</th><th>operation</th>
      </tr>
      <tr>
          <td>number</td><td>
          <ul>
              <li>any byte,short,int,long,float,double elementary read or;</li>
              <li>initialization of any above sequence read or;</li>
              <li>continuation of above initialized sequence of matching type;</li>
          </ul>
          </td>
      </tr>
      <tr>
          <td>boolean</td><td>
          <ul>
              <li>boolean read or;</li>
              <li>initialization of boolean sequence read or;</li>
              <li>continuation of above initialized boolean sequence;</li>
          </ul>
          </td>
      </tr>
      <tr>
          <td>String or an inside of a string</td><td>
          <ul>
              <li>char read or;</li>
              <li>initialization of char sequence or String read or;</li>
              <li>continuation of above initialized read</li>
          </ul>
          </td>
      </tr>
      </table>
      If sequence operation is initialized and a JSON element incompatible
      with this sequence is encountered then EBrokenFormat is to be thrown.
      For Java String or char [] reading operation the reading
      may get past one JSON string to another, ie:
      <pre>
           [ "ally","zoe" ]
      </pre>
      can be read as:
      <pre>
           readChar()=='a'
           readChar(char []...) =="llyzoe"
           <i>or</i>
           readString() =="allyzoe"
           <i>or</i>
           readChar()=='a'
           readChar()=='l'
           readChar()=='l'
           ....
           readChar()=='e'
      </pre>
      And a JSON:
      <pre>
           [ "ad",1033,45,-3 ]
      </pre>
      can be read as:
      <pre>
           readChar()='a'
           readChar()='d'
           readShort()=1033
      </pre>
      but cannot be read as:
      <pre>
           readString() - unexpected element: number 1033
      </pre>
      nor
      <pre>
           readChar()='a'
           readChar()='d'
           readByte()=1033 - not a byte, number out of range
      </pre>



      <h2>Signals</h2>
      <h3>Begin signal</h3>
      A begin signal is written as an opening of JSON object:
      <pre>
           { "<i>signal_name</i>" :
      </pre>
      then if next operation is:
      <ul>
          <li>elementary write then it is postponed till second operation.
          If second operation is not <code>end</code> the "[" is written,
          <i>array mode</i> is turned on, and both operations are written;</li>
          <li>string or char sequence, then this is written without "["
          and <i>array mode</i> is turned off.
          <p>
          This is required however
          in this case, that entire sequence is represented as a one JSON string.
          <p>
          If it is not possible the "[" should be written and <i>array mode</i> should
          be turned on;</li>
          <li><code>end</code> then JSON <code>null</code> is written
          and the <code>end</code> signal is processed;</li>
          <li><code>begin</code> then "[" is written, <i>array mode</i>
          is turned on and begin signal is written in a regular way;</li>
      </ul>
      Note: <i>array mode</i> is a single flag which can be in turned off state
      only for begin followed by a single numeric, boolean or JSON string.
      <p>
      <i>Note: the postponing of elementary write allows us to avoid using [] for
      single element structures. We cannot however postpone begin to avoid [] since
      it may be deeply nested or very long and the postponing it would require
      an unpredictably large buffer.</i>

      <h3>End signal</h3>
      If <i>array mode</i> is on:
      <pre>
         ]}
      </pre> is written.
      <p>
      If <i>array mode</i> is off:
      <pre>
         }
      </pre> is written.


      <h1>Examples</h1>
      <h2>Just primitive elements</h2>
      A stream produced by primitive operations only do look like:
      <pre>
        [ 3,true,false,-34.0e5,"mister" ]
      </pre>
      <h2>With structure</h2>
      <pre>
        [
          { "struct1": 33 }, //A single element structure
          { "struct3": "morka" }, //A structure carrying a char sequence only
          { "struct": null },  //an empty structure
          { "seq": [33,55,"zooooo"]}, //A struct with elementary data followed by String/char[]
          { "nested":
            [
              { "zoo": [ 34,false] },
              77,34,344,555 ]      //this can be interpreted as an array too.
              }
         ]
      </pre>


     <h1>Additional information</h1>
     JSON stream is by definition not typed and process of reading it may differ from
     the process of writing it. For an example a sequence of JSON numbers may be read
     both with elementary primitives and with elementary sequence operation.
     <p>
     This is intentional since it simplifies the processing a lot.
