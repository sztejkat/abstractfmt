	A configuration, patterns and demos for how to
	construct "contract test suites".
	
	<h1>What is "contract test suite"?</h1>
	This is a set of <i>test cases</i> which are expected
	to test if implementation of contract X is doing what
	contract X declares.
	<p>
	In our case it will be always used as a pair of
	read-write contracts and will use first contract to write
	data and second to read them back. Thous it may validate
	if it works correctly.
	
	<h1>What is "test case"</h1>
	A bunch of tests focused on some subject collected in
	a single test class.
	
	<h1>Why not just plain TestXXX class?</h1>
	<ol>
		<li>because we like to apply tests to different implemenentations
		of contract;</li>
		<li>because tests appears to be huge;</li>
		<li>because some contracts may require, just during development,
		to have fine-tuned subset of tests;</li>
	</ol>
	
	<h1>Where is a problem?</h1>
	Basically in how to force Junit to create specific instance of
	"device under test" for each tests <u>in many test case classes</u>/
