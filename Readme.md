This project contains a set of definitions of an
"abstract stream format".

# Introduction

Have You ever had enough of XML? Had You ever struggled
with what format You should choose for Your data? XML? JSON?
E... too much size overhead... maybe then java Serialization?
Well... no, too much tied to Java. So maybe You should directly
use java.io.DataOutputStream?

Decissions, decissions, decissions....

If You ever wondered about it, this is a place You should read.
Not necessairly take a code and use, but at least read about concepts.

# An event based format

This package introduces multi-level specification of a abstract
data format. Some of its concepts are Java specific, but some can
be used in other languages.
