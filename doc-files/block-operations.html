	In this chapter I will discuss some rationales behind block operations
        <ul>
            <li><code>byte[]</code>:
                 <ul>
                    <li>because almost all raw binary
                     data (ie. images) are represented as byte-blocks;</li>
                    <li>any binary data, if necessary can be turned to
                    byte blocks;</li>
                    <li>in XML like format encoding raw binary data
                    as sequence of:
                    <pre>
                         &lt;byte&gt;0x34&lt;byte/&gt;
                    </pre>
                    is not only a waste of resources but also pointless since
                    human may not benefit from reading raw binary data
                    </li>
                 </ul>
            </li>
            <li><code>char[]</code>:
                 <ul>
                 <li>because they are used in <code>Strings</code>
                     and <code>Strings</code> may greatly benefit from UTF-8 encoding;</li>
                 <li>because exactly the same primitive operation code may be used
                 to write "signal names" and other data which are internal to format;</li>
                 </ul>
            </li>
            <li><code>boolean[]</code> because they can be bit-packed,
            but bit packing of sequences of bits into sequences of bytes is
            not trivial when multiple writes are used.</li>
            <li>other arrays:
            <ul>
            	 <li>they can be implemented either over primitive writes or
            	 over <code>byte[]</code> at low overhead;</li>
            	 <li>they are not used to represent raw data, so in XML like
            	 format human may benefit from reading them and encoding
            	 them in compact way may be not a best idea;</li>
            </ul>
            </li>
        </ul>
