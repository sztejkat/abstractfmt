      A generic, signal based format with dedicated methods
    used to perform elementary operations and means of automatic
    format recognition and creation.
    <p>
    For a formal description of <i>signal/event format</i> see
    <a href="sztejkat/abstractfmt/package-summary.html">this package description</a>.
    <p>
    This document contains informal background informations about concepts used
    in this library.

    <h1>Why next kind of format?</h1>
    Because I like it?
    <p>
    Seriously?
    <p>
    No, just kidding.
    <p>
    Because I don't like to use library X to save my data in format A.
    Then use library Y to save my data in format B. Then I don't like to
    decide at the same beginning on what exactly data format will I
    use for retaining my data.
    <p>
    And even more important, because I <u>need</u> to change the format
    later.

    <h2>Human readable or compact &amp; fast</h2>
    This is the usuall choice to make. You can use JSON/XML/YAML whatever
    and have hard to parse, bloated up but human readable format.
    <p>
    This is fine choice on PC, You can always ZIP it, right?
    <p>
    Well....
    <p>
    I do also program microcontrollers. And the space is scarce there. So in
    many, many applications which are in my area of interest the compactness
    of format is critical.
    <p>
    On the other hand, if I choose the compact, binary format I will have
    a really hard work at debugging it. Or at moving data to an another program.
    <p>
    Damn.... choices, choices, choices.

    <h2>Basic idea</h2>
    There is one class in standard JAVA which has <i>almost</i> ideal contract.
    This is the good old <code>java.io.DataInput</code>/<code>java.io.DataOutput</code>
    <p>
    I say it is <i>almost</i> ideal because:
    <ul>
        <li>it clearly specifies how exactly data are encoded in binary form. But hey, who
        will make us to obey it if we provide both ends of stream?</li>
        <li>it does not allow:
               <ul>
                   <li>declaring <i>structured</i> named data;</li>
                   <li>ignoring data You don't care or know about;</li>
                   <li>processing streams of unknown data structure;</li>
               </ul>
        </li>
    </ul>
    Some ideas came from standard serialization specs.
    <p>
    First good idea in serialization is that basically all data
    are saved as named and typed elements (please ignore for that moment how exactly
    it is done). This is a briliant idea which can survive numerous data format changes.
    But it bloats up size and adds complexity.
    <p>
    Second idea is about how the <code>private void readObject(ObjectInputStream ex)</code>
    is feed with the input data. The serialization specs are saying, that whatever belongs to
    an object but is NOT read by this method from a stream is silently skipped. This opens
    an easy path to versioning, extending data format and etc.
    <p>
    Of course serialization is briliant, but old. Very old. Almost as old as I am. And as
    each oldie which was Young at those days was not designed with thinking about everything.
    It was revolutionary enough those days.
    There is a <u>plenty</u> conceptual and implementation flaws in it.
    <p>
    When I was playing with serialization I was seriously hit by one problem: when You do
    serialize Your data with Java serialization You are stuck with serialization binary format.
    And it is a hell of pain to use it to serialize <u>the same set of objects</u> to <u>different format</u>.

    <h2>So take serialization library X....</h2>
    There is a plenty of serialization libraries. Really. The problem is that they are always
    created in a way in which they are almost 1:1 bound with a specific binary/text stream format.
    <p>
    And, obviously, using serialization to just store simple data is like shooting with a cannon
    to the mosquito. You can do it, but it is a bit too much.
    <p>
    So I was thinking: I need something what is conceptually like JSON/XML/etc, but is <u>NOT</u> JSON/XML/etc.
    and what will be as easy to use as <code>DataInput/DataOutput</code>.


    <h2>Named data blocks</h2>
    The basic need is to be able to tell that there are some data about something.
    <p>
    In other words I need to be able to name some <i>block of data</i> to provide a kind of structural information.
    XML is good in that area, allowing to enclose some block of text and give it a meaning.

    <h2>Type information</h2>
    Obviously naming the data is not enough. In XML and JSON it may be enough, but in binary formats, well....
    You may of course know a'priori when and what method to call to read data (ie. read byte, read int).
    Unfortunately with such an approach You also <u>must</u> have such knowledge. And this is a reall
    problem when You plan an upgrade path for Your data and aim at downwards compatibility.
    <p>
    Due to that I <i>may like to be able</i> to add type information about what exact data forms (ie. number,
    int, float, etc.) is stored in a data block. And I like to be able to add it in a very, very compact way.
    <p>
    And, of course, it should happen without me doing anything - if I request it the type information 
    should just add itself.


    <h2>Skipping unknown content</h2>
    Having blocks of data, either named or un-named should allow me to simply ignore some of them. Excactly
    as XML do. I like this functionality. I hate formats in which I can't skip blocks I don't care about
    without parsing them. Taking XML you may just count &lt; and &lt;/ (obviously bug prone, but You can get
    the drift) and skip whatever You don't care about not even <u>knowing anything</u> about it.
    <p>
    On the contrary in JAVA class file, if You encounter the record of type X which You don't care, You still
    have to parse it because You can't just read what size it is. This becomes even trickier, if not only You
    don't care about the record, but You can't recognize it because it is from a newer class file version than
    Your code knows about.
    <p>
    I don't like it case. Especially because I had to write once a code to extract some data from
    ASCII human readable format which was made around lines:
    <pre>
    ELEMENT <i>name</i>,<i>type</i>,<i>shapes count</i>,<i>attributes count</i>
    LINE <i>x0,y0,x1,y1</i>                    \
    POLYGON <i>x0,y0,segments count</i>        |+ those are possible shapes.
    SEGMENT <i>dx,dy</i>                       /
    ATTRIBUTE <i>name</i>,<i>value</i>             \
    MULTILINE_ATTRIBUTE <i>name</i>,<i>lines</i>   |+ those are possible atrribute formats.
    <i>text</i>                             /
    </pre>
    to just extract a <u>single attribute</u> for each of elements.
    <p>
    Can You do it without parsing the shape definitions?


    <h2>Boundary checking</h2>
    In the C/C++ word the 99% of cracks and hacks are about <i>exceeding data boundaries</i>. Reading past the
    block, writing past the buffer and etc. I don't like it.
    <p>
    And again, having blocks of data allows You to implement them in such a way, that they will simply complain
    if You read past the end of it. You can read whatever is <u>inside a block</u>, but reading across the block
    boundary may be detected and an exception may be thrown.


    <h2>Dumb transcoding</h2>
    Ok, no imagine You have two pairs of <code>DataInput/DataOutptu</code>. Both are breaking contract, since
    pair A is reading and writing XML and pair B is reading and writing JSON.
    <p>
    Wouldn't it be great to just be able to read from A DataInput and write it to B DataOutput?
    <p>
    It would be great. But to do it a stream must be <i>described</i>. And for best result - <u>self described</u>.
    You should be able to ask A DataInput: <i>"What method should I call to read what You carry next?"</i>
    and simply call it paired with an apropriate B DataOutput method.
    <p>
    This is next functionality I need.


    <h2>Infinite life and data</h2>
    The stream must be able to live forever and transfer data of infinite size. It does not mean
    it has to have infinite memory. Sending an array of ints does not mean: <i>"To have an array in memory
    and dump it to stream"</i>. Data may be produced on demand.
    <p>
    And at reading end there is the same: data may be consumed item by item and the entire array may never
    come to existence.
    <p>
    Why not let it to be infinite?

    <p>
    <i>Note: Serialization can't live infinitely long. It leaks memory on both ends and leaks reference identifiers.
    And obviously it can't transfer infinite arrays because it transfers objects which do reside in RAM.</i>


    <h2>Compact arrays</h2>
    Since I <i>sometimes</i> like my format to be compact I like to think that arrays should have own API to let
    stream store them in specific and efficient way.
    <p>
    The good example is SVG embedded bitmap image. The SVG is XML so it <i>could</i> store an image as a, for an example,
    sequence of:
    <pre>
         &lt;pixel&gt;
               &lt;R&gt;0.99&lt;/R&gt;
               &lt;G&gt;0.99&lt;/G&gt;
               &lt;B&gt;0.99&lt;/B&gt;
         &lt;/pixel&gt;
    </pre>
    Does it do it that way? No. It encodes images in a most compact way possible in XML. I like it.
    But I like to have a choice.


    <h1>Robustness</h1>
    Data formats must be robust. But format may be only as robust as the <i>contract</i> it is implementing is.
    <p>
    I will now point You some examples about how some solutions are <u>not robust</u>.

    <h2>DataInput</h2>
    Let us take a look on <code>DataInput</code>. Precisely speaking on:
    <pre>
         String readUTF()throws IOException;
    </pre>
    What is wrong with it?
    <p>
    There is no adjustable size limit. According to contract the max length of string is 64k <u>bytes</u>.
    Notice: <u>bytes</u>. Not characters. Bytes. After a hard to predict UTF-8 encoding.
    <p>
    This is bad i two ways: first You can't store all strings You like. And second, You must be <u>always
    prepared</u> to read 64k bytes.
    <p>
    Removing the upper limit is <i>easy</i>. We already break the contract not encoding it in a binary
    form, so we can remove the limit....
    <p>
    And break even more. If the limit is removed, and there is no:
    <pre>
          String readUTF(int max_length)throws IOException;
    </pre>
    limited read method, then the errornous data source may produce a stream with string long enough to
    produce <u>OutOfMemoryException</u> or cause so hard swapping that our system will freeze.
    <p>
    <i>Note: The same problem applies to any arrays, lists, sequences of data and etc. You may attempt
    to kill JSON with "value"="1.0000....and so on for 4GB"</i>

    <h2>Serialization</h2>
    The serialization has own dangers. And in fact almost any un-bound generic format has such dangers.
    <p>
    Serialization is <u>recursive</u>. It read objects calling <i>readObject0</i> method. If inside this
    object is an another object, it just calls <i>readObject0</i> again to read it. And again, and again,
    as the data stream dicates, up to <code>StackOverflowException</code>. This is one of nastiest
    exceptions from which it is almost as tricky to recover, as from <code>OutOfMemoryException</code>.
    <p>
    Robust format must be able to control recursion depth and reject streams nested too deep.


    <h1>So what I would like to see?</h1>

    A slightly modified <code>DataOutput</code> with abilities to:
    <ul>
        <li>write blocks boundaries and name those boundaries;</li>
        <li>have an option to write type information about primitives stored in stream;</li>
        <li>have an ability to write arrays, esp. byte[] as compact, infinite structures;</li>
        <li>live infinitely and write infinite data;</li>
    </ul>
    and at reading end and <code>DataInput</code> which should be able to read above and:
    <ul>
        <li>skip unread data in block;</li>
        <li>prevent cross boundary reads, too deep recursion and data longer that expected;</li>
        <li>be able to read the type information if present;</li>
        <li>and if type information is present, to validate if I read it with a proper method;</li>
    </ul>
    Those contracts should just specify <u>how to use them</u> and be completly unaware of
    what format is actually used. XML? No problem. JSON? Why not? Binary? Of course. Anything You
    create. Completely transparent.
